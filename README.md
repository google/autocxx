This project is a tool for calling C++ from Rust in a heavily automated, but safe, fashion.

The intention is that it has all the fluent safety from [cxx](https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx) whilst generating interfaces automatically from existing C++ headers using a variant of [bindgen](https://docs.rs/bindgen/0.54.1/bindgen/). Think of autocxx as glue which plugs bindgen into cxx.

# Overview

```cpp
namespace base {
  class Bob {
  public:
      Bob(std::string name);
      ...
      void do_a_thing() const;
  };
}
```

```rust
use autocxx::include_cpp;

include_cpp!{
    #include "base/bob.h"
    generate!("Bob")
}

let a = ffi::base::Bob::make_unique("hello");
a.do_a_thing();
```

See [demo/src/main.rs](demo/src/main.rs) for a basic example, and the [examples](examples/) directory for more.

The existing cxx facilities are used to allow safe ownership of C++ types from Rust; specifically things like `std::unique_ptr` and `std::string` - so the Rust code should not typically require use of unsafe code, unlike with normal `bindgen` bindings.

# How it works

Before building the Rust code, you must run a code generator (typically run in a `build.rs` for a Cargo setup.)

This:

* First, runs `bindgen` to generate some bindings (with all the usual `unsafe`, `#[repr(C)]` etc.)
* Second, interprets and converts them to bindings suitable for `cxx::bridge`.
* Thirdly, runs `cxx::bridge` to create the C++ bindings.
* Fourthly, writes out a `.rs` file with the Rust bindings.

When building your Rust code, the procedural macro boils down to an `include!` macro that pulls in the
generated Rust code.

# Current state of affairs

There is an example of this macro working within the `demo` directory.

The project also contains test code which does this end-to-end, for all sorts of C++ types and constructs which we eventually would like to support.

| Type | Status |
| ---- | ------ |
| Primitives (u8, etc.) | Works |
| Plain-old-data structs | Works |
| std::unique_ptr of POD | Works |
| std::unique_ptr of std::string | Works |
| std::unique_ptr of opaque types | - |
| Reference to POD | Works |
| Reference to std::string | Works |
| Classes | Works, but with warnings |
| Methods | Works (classes give warnings) |
| Int #defines | Works |
| String #defines | Works |
| Primitive constants | Works |
| Enums | Works, though more thought needed |
| #ifdef, #if etc. | - |
| Typedefs | Infinite permutations, some of which work |
| Structs containing UniquePtr | Works |
| Structs containing strings | Works (opaque only) |
| Passing opaque structs (owned by UniquePtr) into C++ functions which take them by value | Works |
| Passing opaque structs (owned by UniquePtr) into C++ methods which take them by value | Works, but with non-ideal syntax |
| Constructors/make_unique | Works, though probably many problems |
| Destructors | Works via cxx `UniquePtr` already |
| Inline functions | Works |
| Construction of std::unique_ptr<std::string> in Rust | Works |
| Namespaces | Works, but a known limitation |
| std::vector | Works |
| Field access to opaque objects via UniquePtr | - |
| Plain-old-data structs containing opaque fields | Impossible by design, but may not be ergonomic so may need more thought |
| Reference counting, std::shared_ptr | - |
| std::optional | - |
| Function pointers | - |
| Unique ptrs to primitives | - |
| Inheritance from pure virtual classes | - |
| Generic (templated) types | Works though likely many problems |

The plan is (roughly) to work through the above list of features and fix corner cases. This project is deliberately incremental. There are open questions about whether the end result is ergonomic and performant: specifically, whether it's acceptable to hold opaque C++ types always by `UniquePtr` in Rust. Until we know more, this project is considered experimental and we don't advise using it for anything in production.

# On safety

This crate mostly intends to follow the lead of the `cxx` crate in where and when `unsafe` is required. But, this crate is opinionated. It believes some unsafety requires more careful review than other bits, along the following spectrum:

* Rust unsafe code (requires most review)
* Rust code calling C++ with raw pointers
* Rust code calling C++ with shared pointers, or anything else where there can be concurrent mutation
* Rust code calling C++ with unique pointers, where the Rust single-owner model nearly always applies (but we can't _prove_ that the C++ developer isn't doing something weird)
* Rust safe code (requires least review)

If your project is 90% Rust code, with small bits of C++, don't use this crate. You need something where all C++ interaction is marked with big red "this is terrifying" flags. This crate is aimed at cases where there's 90% C++ and small bits of Rust, and so we want the Rust code to be pragmatically reviewable without the signal:noise ratio of `unsafe` in the Rust code becoming so bad that `unsafe` loses all value.

See [safety!] in the documentation for more details.

# Build environment

Because this uses `bindgen`, and `bindgen` may depend on the state of your system C++ headers, it is somewhat sensitive. It requires [llvm to be installed due to bindgen](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/requirements.html)

As with `cxx`, this generates both Rust and C++ side bindings code. You'll
need to take steps to generate the C++ code: either by using the `build.rs` integration within
`autocxx_build`, or the command line utility within `autocxx_gen`. Either way, you'll need
to specify the Rust file(s) which have `include_cpp` macros in place, and suitable corresponding
C++ and Rust code will be generated.

When you come to build your Rust code, it will expand to an `include!` macro which will pull
in the generated Rust code. For this to work, you need to specify an `AUTOCXX_RS` environment
variable such that the macro can discover the location of the .rs file which was generated.
If you use the `build.rs` cargo integration, this happens automatically. You'll also need
to ensure that you build and link against the C++ code. Again, if you use the Cargo integrationm
and follow the pattern of the `demo` example, this is fairly automatic because we use
`cc` for this. (There's also the option of `AUTOCXX_RS_FILE` if your build system needs to
specify the precise file name used for the `.rs` file which is `include!`ed).

You'll also want to ensure that the code generation (both Rust and C++ code) happens whenever
any included header file changes. This is now handled automatically by our
`build.rs` integration, but is not yet done for the standalone `autocxx-gen` tool.

See [here](https://docs.rs/autocxx/latest/autocxx/macro.include_cpp.html#configuring-the-build) for a diagram.

Finally, this interop inevitably involves lots of fiddly small functions. It's likely to perform
far better if you can achieve cross-language LTO. https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx/issues/371
may give some useful hints - see also all the build-related help in https://cxx.rs/ which all
applies here too.

# Directory structure

* `demo` - a demo example
* `parser` - code which parses a single `include_cpp!` macro. Used by both the macro
  (which doesn't do much) and the code generator (which does much more, by means of
  `engine` below)
* `engine` - all the core code for actual code generation.
* `macro` - the procedural macro which expands the Rust code.
* `gen/build` - a library to be used from `build.rs` scripts to generate .cc and .h
  files from an `include_cxx` section.
* `gen/cmd` - a command-line tool which does the same.
* `src` (outermost project) - a wrapper crate which imports the procedural macro and
  a few other things.

# Where to start reading

The main algorithm is in `engine/src/lib.rs`, in the function `generate()`. This asks
`bindgen` to generate a heap of Rust code and then passes it into
`engine/src/conversion` to convert it to be a format suitable for input
to `cxx`.

However, most of the actual code is in `engine/src/conversion/mod.rs`.

At the moment we're using a slightly branched version of `bindgen` called `autocxx-bindgen`.
It's hoped this is temporary; some of our changes are sufficiently weird that it would be presumptious to try to get them accepted upstream until we're sure `autocxx` has roughly the right approach.

# How to develop

If you're making a change, here's what you need to do to get useful diagnostics etc.
First of all, `cargo run` in the `demo` directory. If it breaks, you don't get much
in the way of useful diagnostics, because `stdout` is swallowed by cargo build scripts.
So, practically speaking, you would almost always move onto running one of the tests
in the test suite. With suitable options, you can get plenty of output. For instance:

```
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 RUST_LOG=autocxx_engine=info cargo test  integration_tests::test_cycle_string_full_pipeline -- --nocapture
```

This is especially valuable to see the `bindgen` output Rust code, and then the converted Rust code which we pass into cxx. Usually, most problems are due to some mis-conversion somewhere
in `engine/src/conversion`. See [here](https://docs.rs/autocxx-engine/latest/autocxx_engine/struct.IncludeCpp.html) for documentation and diagrams on how the engine works.

# Reporting bugs

If you've found a problem, and you're reading this, *thank you*! Your diligence
in reporting the bug is much appreciated and will make `autocxx` better. In
order of preference here's how we would like to hear about your problem:

* Raise a pull request adding a new failing integration test to
  `engine/src/integration_tests.rs`.
* Minimize the test using `tools/reduce`, something like this:
  `target/debug/autocxx-reduce -d "safety!(unsafe_ffi)" -d
  'generate_pod!("A")' -I ~/my-include-dir -h my-header.h -p
  problem-error-message -- --remove-pass pass_line_markers`
  This is a wrapper for the amazing `creduce` which will take thousands of lines
  of C++, preprocess it, and then identify the minimum required lines to
  reproduce the same problem.
* Use the C++ preprocessor to give a single complete C++ file which demonstrates
  the problem, along with the `include_cpp!` directive you use.
* Failing all else, build using
  `cargo clean -p <your package name> && RUST_LOG=autocxx_engine=info cargo build -vvv`
  and send the _entire_ log to us. This will include two key bits of logging:
  the C++ bindings as distilled by `bindgen`, and then the version which
  we've converted and moulded to be suitable for use by `cxx`.

# Credits

David Tolnay did much of the hard work here, by inventing the underlying cxx crate, and in fact nearly all of the parsing infrastructure on which this crate depends. `bindgen` is also awesome. This crate stands on the shoulders of giants!
