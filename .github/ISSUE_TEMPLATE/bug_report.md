**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior with appropriate Rust and C++ code snippets. Ideally, please raise a new pull request with a failing test - instructions are [here](https://google.github.io/autocxx/contributing.html#reporting-bugs). If that isn't possible, a few other options are listed too.

About half of the time people report bugs, they're not readily reproducible. That wastes time for everyone. That's why it's incredibly useful to have a test case which definitely fails. Thanks!

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Additional context**
