/// Include some C++ headers in your Rust project.
///
/// This macro allows you to include one or more C++ headers within
/// your Rust code, and call their functions fairly naturally.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// C++ header (`input.h`):
/// ```cpp
/// #include <cstdint>
///
/// uint32_t do_math(uint32_t a);
/// ```
///
/// Rust code:
/// ```
/// # use autocxx_macro::include_cpp_impl as include_cpp;
/// include_cpp!(
/// #   parse_only!()
///     #include "input.h"
///     generate!("do_math")
///     safety!(unsafe)
/// );
///
/// # mod ffi { pub fn do_math(a: u32) -> u32 { a+3 } }
/// # fn main() {
/// ffi::do_math(3);
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// The resulting bindings will use idiomatic Rust wrappers for types from the [cxx]
/// crate, for example [`cxx::UniquePtr`] or [`cxx::CxxString`]. Due to the care and thought
/// that's gone into the [cxx] crate, such bindings are pleasant and idiomatic to use
/// from Rust, and usually don't require the `unsafe` keyword.
///
/// For full documentation, see [the manual](https://google.github.io/autocxx/).
///
/// # The [`include_cpp`] macro
///
/// Within the braces of the `include_cpp!{...}` macro, you should provide
/// a list of at least the following:
///
/// * `#include "cpp_header.h"`: a header filename to parse and include
/// * `generate!("type_or_function_name")`: a type or function name whose declaration
///   should be made available to C++. (See the section on Allowlisting, below).
/// * Optionally, `safety!(unsafe)` - see discussion of [`safety`].
///
/// Other directives are possible as documented in this crate.
///
/// Now, try to build your Rust project. `autocxx` may fail to generate bindings
/// for some of the items you specified with [generate] directives: remove
/// those directives for now, then see the next section for advice.
///
/// # Allowlisting
///
/// How do you inform autocxx which bindings to generate? There are three
/// strategies:
///
/// * *Recommended*: provide various [`generate`] directives in the
///   [`include_cpp`] macro. This can specify functions or types.
/// * *Not recommended*: in your `build.rs`, call [`Builder::auto_allowlist`].
///   This will attempt to spot _uses_ of FFI bindings anywhere in your Rust code
///   and build the allowlist that way. This is experimental and has known limitations.
/// * *Strongly not recommended*: use [`generate_all`]. This will attempt to
///   generate Rust bindings for _any_ C++ type or function discovered in the
///   header files. This is generally a disaster if you're including any
///   remotely complex header file: we'll try to generate bindings for all sorts
///   of STL types. This will be slow, and some may well cause problems.
///   Effectively this is just a debug option to discover such problems. Don't
///   use it!
///
/// # Internals
///
/// For documentation on how this all actually _works_, see
/// `IncludeCppEngine` within the `autocxx_engine` crate.
