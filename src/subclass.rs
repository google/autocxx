/// You can use this in two ways:
/// * As an attribute macro on a struct which is to be a subclass.
///   In this case, you must specify the superclass as described below.
///   For instance,
///   ```nocompile
///   # use autocxx_macro::subclass as subclass;
///   #[subclass(superclass("MyCppSuperclass"))]
///   struct Bar {};
///   ```
/// * as a directive within the [crate::include_cpp] macro, in which case you
///   must provide two arguments of the superclass and then the
///   subclass:
///   ```
///   # use autocxx_macro::include_cpp_impl as include_cpp;
///   include_cpp!(
///   #   parse_only!()
///       #include "input.h"
///       subclass!("MyCppSuperclass",Bar)
///       safety!(unsafe)
///   );
///   struct Bar {
///     // ...
///   }
///   ```
///   In this latter case, you'll need to implement the trait
///   [`CppSubclass`] for the struct, so it's
///   generally easier to use the former option.

/// A subclass of a C++ type.
///
/// To create a Rust subclass of a C++ class, you must do these things:
/// * Create a `struct` to act as your subclass, and add the #[`macro@crate::subclass`] attribute.
///   This adds a field to your struct for autocxx record-keeping. You can
///   instead choose to implement [`CppSubclass`] a different way, in which case
///   you must provide the [`macro@crate::subclass`] inside your [`crate::include_cpp`]
///   macro. (`autocxx` will do the required codegen for your subclass
///   whether it discovers a [`macro@crate::subclass`] directive inside your
///   [`crate::include_cpp`], or elsewhere used as an attribute macro,
///   or both.)
/// * Use the [`CppSubclass`] trait, and instantiate the subclass using
///   [`CppSubclass::new_rust_owned`] or [`CppSubclass::new_cpp_owned`]
///   constructors. (You can use [`CppSubclassSelfOwned`] if you need that
///   instead; also, see [`CppSubclassSelfOwnedDefault`] and [`CppSubclassDefault`]
///   to arrange for easier constructors to exist.
/// * You _may_ need to implement [`CppPeerConstructor`] for your subclass,
///   but only if autocxx determines that there are multiple possible superclass
///   constructors so you need to call one explicitly (or if there's a single
///   non-trivial superclass constructor.) autocxx will implement this trait
///   for you if there's no ambiguity and FFI functions are safe to call due to
///   `autocxx::safety!` being used.
///
/// # How to access your Rust structure from outside
///
/// Use [`CppSubclass::new_rust_owned`] then use [`std::cell::RefCell::borrow`]
/// or [`std::cell::RefCell::borrow_mut`] to obtain the underlying Rust struct.
///
/// # How to call C++ methods on the subclass
///
/// Do the same. You should find that your subclass struct `impl`s all the
/// C++ methods belonging to the superclass.
///
/// # How to implement virtual methods
///
/// Simply add an `impl` for the `struct`, implementing the relevant method.
/// The C++ virtual function call will be redirected to your Rust implementation.
///
/// # How _not_ to implement virtual methods
///
/// If you don't want to implement a virtual method, don't: the superclass
/// method will be called instead. Naturally, you must implement any pure virtual
/// methods.
///
/// # How it works
///
/// This actually consists of two objects: this object itself and a C++-side
/// peer. The ownership relationship between those two things can work in three
/// different ways:
/// 1. Neither object is owned by Rust. The C++ peer is owned by a C++
///    [`UniquePtr`] held elsewhere in C++. That C++ peer then owns
///    this Rust-side object via a strong [`Rc`] reference. This is the
///    ownership relationship set up by [`CppSubclass::new_cpp_owned`].
/// 2. The object pair is owned by Rust. Specifically, by a strong
///    [`Rc`] reference to this Rust-side object. In turn, the Rust-side object
///    owns the C++-side peer via a [`UniquePtr`]. This is what's set up by
///    [`CppSubclass::new_rust_owned`]. The C++-side peer _does not_ own the Rust
///    object; it just has a weak pointer. (Otherwise we'd get a reference
///    loop and nothing would ever be freed.)
/// 3. The object pair is self-owned and will stay around forever until
///    [`CppSubclassSelfOwned::delete_self`] is called. In this case there's a strong reference
///    from the C++ to the Rust and from the Rust to the C++. This is useful
///    for cases where the subclass is listening for events, and needs to
///    stick around until a particular event occurs then delete itself.
///
/// # Limitations
///
/// * *Re-entrancy*. The main thing to look out for is re-entrancy. If a
///   (non-const) virtual method is called on your type, which then causes you
///   to call back into C++, which results in a _second_ call into a (non-const)
///   virtual method, we will try to create two mutable references to your
///   subclass which isn't allowed in Rust and will therefore panic.
///
///   A future version of autocxx may provide the option of treating all
///   non-const methods (in C++) as const methods on the Rust side, which will
///   give the option of using interior mutability ([`std::cell::RefCell`])
///   for you to safely handle this situation, whilst remaining compatible
///   with existing C++ interfaces. If you need this, indicate support on
///   [this issue](https://github.com/google/autocxx/issues/622).
///
/// * *Thread safety*. The subclass object is not thread-safe and shouldn't
///   be passed to different threads in C++. A future version of this code
///   will give the option to use `Arc` and `Mutex` internally rather than
///   `Rc` and `RefCell`, solving this problem.
///
/// * *Protected methods.* We don't do anything clever here - they're public.
///
/// * *Non-trivial class hierarchies*. We don't yet consider virtual methods
///   on base classes of base classes. This is a temporary limitation,
///   [see this issue](https://github.com/google/autocxx/issues/610).
